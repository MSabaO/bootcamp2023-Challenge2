            text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
            the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
            unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
            type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
            also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
            unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
            Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
            with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
            versions of Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established
            fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a
            page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is
            that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
            opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
            readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page
            editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
            search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
            infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
            accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). Where
            does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not
            simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
            literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
            McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
            looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
            Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
            classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
            comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
            Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45
            BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
            during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
            dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The
            standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced
            below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de
            Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their
            exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
            translation by H. Rackham. Where can I get some? There are many
            variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority
