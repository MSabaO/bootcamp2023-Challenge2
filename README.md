# bootcamp2023-Challenge2

## Description

This challenge was completed to demonstrate the use what I have learned of advance CSS in week #2 of the UNB Coding Bootcamp.

In this opportunity I was able create the first version of my own porfolio by using the tools provided in the first 2 weeks of class. Organize and merge some of the CSS elements and play around with the responsiveness.

Unfortunately, I was not able to make it fully functional and I will try another attempt later.
